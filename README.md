# intelligent Apple Leaf Disease Detection Using CNN & ML
🧪 Apple Leaf Disease Detection using CNN + Traditional ML This project leverages deep learning (EfficientNetB0) for feature extraction and traditional machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, KNN) for classification of apple leaf diseases. It detects common diseases like Apple Scab, Black Rot, and Cedar Apple Rust, as well as healthy leaves, using a clean Streamlit web interface.  🔍 Key Features 🌿 Disease Detection: Identifies diseases from leaf images.  🧠 EfficientNetB0: Pretrained CNN used for robust feature extraction.  ⚙️ Traditional ML Models: SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression.  🎨 Image Segmentation: Visual highlighting of diseased regions using color masking.  📊 Model Selector: Choose between different models for comparison.
